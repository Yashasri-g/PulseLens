# PulseLens – AI-Powered Real-Time Economic & Social Health Dashboard

## Overview
**PulseLens** is an open-source, AI-driven dashboard that provides **real-time, multi-domain insights** into the economic, social, and environmental health of regions.  
It aggregates **public data** from trusted global sources, applies **predictive analytics**, and delivers **interactive visualizations** to help governments, enterprises, NGOs, and researchers make faster, data-backed decisions.

Unlike traditional dashboards, PulseLens integrates **economic indicators, public sentiment, and environmental health** into a single, **self-updating platform** with forecasting capabilities.

## Why It Matters
In a rapidly changing world, decisions need to be based on **timely and holistic data**.  
PulseLens solves the problem of fragmented, outdated analytics by:
- Pulling **real-time data** from multiple APIs.
- Using **AI/ML models** for short-term trend forecasting.
- Providing **interactive and geospatial visualizations**.
- Highlighting **early warning signals** for policymakers, investors, and social organizations.

## MVP Scope – Core Indicators
For the first release, PulseLens will track and predict **four key indicators**:

1. **Unemployment Rate** – Core economic health metric.  
   *Source:* World Bank API, OECD API.  

2. **Inflation Rate (CPI)** – Cost-of-living and purchasing power indicator.  
   *Source:* World Bank API, IMF Data API.  

3. **Public Sentiment Index** – Social mood and trust levels via NLP on public data.  
   *Source:* Twitter API (Academic Access), News APIs, Reddit datasets.  

4. **Air Quality Index (AQI)** – Environmental health and pollution levels.  
   *Source:* OpenAQ API, WHO Air Quality Database.
